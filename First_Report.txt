Gambot: the minichess player
Rubin Stricklin
Gambot is written in python2, after being written
in python3 and being too slow and after I almost
completed Gambot in Java. The reason that it
performs so much better in python2 is because
I can compile it with pypy.

Gambot is able to do alphabeta at depth 4 on my
laptop with pypy and 6 on babbage without it

After I got my move generator working, I made a
game driver along with random and human players
so that I could better interact with Gambot. It
was harder that I thought it would be to win
against a random player.

Then I made a material evaluation function which is
pretty naieve. I plan on doing more tuning of piece
values and adding a pawn stucture evaluation to it.
But this was enough to get started on Negamax.
