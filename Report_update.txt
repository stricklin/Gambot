Gambot: the minichess player
Rubin Stricklin

Much is the same as per my first report,
but now the networking is much less error
prone. I added another module to handle all
of the talking to the server instead of
trying to handle it inside all inside the
network player. All of the previous bugs I
was encountering are gone and I have yet to
send an illegal move or disconnect at an
inappropriate time.
